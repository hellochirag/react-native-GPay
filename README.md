## Usage
  
  â–ª	Setting up Google Pay/Android Pay
	â–ª	Importing the Library
	â–ª	Initializing the Payment Request
	â–ª	Displaying the Payment Request
	â–ª	Aborting the Payment Request (Support Only in Andriod)
	â–ª	Processing Payments
	â–ª	Dismissing the Payment Request
  
  ##	Setting up Google Pay/Android Pay
	
  Before you can start accepting payments in your App, you'll need to setup Google Pay and/or Android Pay.
	â–ª	Android Pay

	1.	Add Android Pay and Google Play Services to your dependencies
	2.	Enable Android Pay in your Manifest

	Google has documentation on how to do this in their _[Setup Android Pay]        (https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/setup)_ guide.
  

##	Importing the Library
	Once Google Pay/Android Pay is enabled in your app, jump into your app's entrypoint and make theÂ PaymentRequestÂ globally available to your app.

		// index.js

```javascript
import GPay, { GooglePayImage } from 'react-native-gpay'

// TODO: What to do with the module?
GPay;
```
##	 Initializing the Payment Request
	To initialize a Payment Request, you'll need to provide Payment Request details.

â–ª  Card Networks Details
 
 ```
   const cardNetworks = ['AMEX', 'JCB', 'MASTERCARD', 'VISA'] // G-PAY SUPPORT CARD.
  ```
  
â–ª  Payment Request Details
    
    The Payment Request is where you defined the forms of payment that you accept. To enable Android Pay, we'll define a payment gatewayÂ ofÂ android-pay. We're also required to pass aÂ dataÂ object to configures android Pay. This is where we provide our merchant id, define the supported card types and the currency we'll be operating in.
   
   ```
   const paymentRequest = {
  cardPaymentMethodMap: {
    gateway: {
      name: 'GATEWAY_NAME', // Identify your gateway and your app's gateway merchant identifier     https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/reference/object#PaymentMethodTokenizationSpecification
      merchantId: '055XXXXXXXXXXXXX336',  // YOUR_GATEWAY_MERCHANT_ID
      clientKey: 'sandbox_XXXXXXXXXXXXndxm44jw', // OPTIONAL YOUR_TOKENIZATION_KEY. Need for BRAINTREE & STRIPE GATEWAY.
      sdkVersion: 'client.VERSION' // OPTIONAL YOUR Client.VERSION. Need for BRAINTREE & STRIPE GATEWAY.
    },
    cardNetworks
  },
  transaction: {
    totalPrice: '11',
    totalPriceStatus: 'FINAL', // PAYMENT AMOUNT STATUS 
    currencyCode: 'USD' // CURRENCY CODE
  },
  merchantName: 'XXXXXXXXXXXX'  // MERCHANT NAME Information about the merchant requesting payment information
}
```

â–ª  Check Google Pay (Android-Pay) Support.

  This function for check GPay Support Your App and Devices?

  ```
  onPressCheck = async () => {
    const isAvailable = await GPay.checkGPayIsEnable(
      GPay.ENVIRONMENT_TEST, // You can change environment here ENVIRONMENT_TEST,ENVIRONMENT_PRODUCTION
      cardNetworks
    ).catch(error => {
      console.warn(error.toString())
      return false
    })
    this.setState({ isAvailable })
  }
  ```
  

Once you've defined your paymentrequest you're ready to initialize your Payment Request.

```es6
  const paymentRequestToken = new GPay(GPay.ENVIRONMENT_TEST, paymentRequest);
```

ðŸš¨ Note: On Android, display items are not displayed within the Android Pay view. Instead, the User Flows documentation suggests showing users a confirmation view where you list the display items. When using React Native Payments, show this view after receiving the PaymentResponse.

## Displaying the Payment Request

Now that you've setup your Payment Request Token, displaying it is as simple as calling the show method.

```paymentRequestToken.show();```

## Processing Payments

Now that we know how to initialize, display, and dismiss a Payment Request, let's take a look at how to process payments.

When a user accepts to pay, GPay.show will resolve to a Payment Response.	

```
  const token = await GPay.show(
      GPay.ENVIRONMENT_TEST, // You can change environment here ENVIRONMENT_TEST,ENVIRONMENT_PRODUCTION
      paymentRequest // 
      ).catch(error => {
      this.setState({ text: `error: ${error}` })
      return error;
    })
```

You can learn more about server-side decrypting of Payment Tokens on Google Payment Token Format Reference documentation.
